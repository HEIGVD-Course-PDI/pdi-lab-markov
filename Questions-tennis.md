==================================

These are the questions related to the tennis model using a discrete-time Markov chain.

You will need to answer the questions in this file. Your answers will be graded. 

You can answer in English or French.


1.1 - Finite Markov chain model
------------------------------

#### How many states does the Markov chain have? (2p)

*Your answer here*


#### What is the size of the transition matrix? (1p)

*Your answer here*


#### Show the transition matrix for p=0.6. (4p)

The matrix must be readable and clear.

1.2 - Limiting distributions
----------------------------

#### How many steps are required for the limiting to converge? (2p)

*Your answer here*


1.3 - Winning probability
-------------------------

#### For `p = 0.6`, what is the probability for player A to win a game? (2p)
