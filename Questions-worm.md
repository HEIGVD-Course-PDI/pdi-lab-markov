Questions to answer - Worm model
==================================

These are the questions related to the worm model using a continuous-time Markov chain.

You will need to answer the questions in this file. Your answers will be graded. 

You can answer in English or French.


2.2 - SIR model
---------------

### If you run the SIR model with `infection_rate=0.1` and `recovery_rate=0.1`, how many people will be infected at the maximum of the epidemic? (1p)

*Your answer here*


### How many people will be infected in total? (2p)

*Your answer here*


### How long does it take until the epidemic is over? (1p)

*Your answer here*


### Show the plot `sir_infection_simulation.png` here. (1p)

*Your answer here*


### The implementation in the file `models/sir.py` counts for 4 points maximum. (4p)


2.3 - Realistic computer worm model
-----------------------------------

### If you run the Worm model with `infection_rate=0.1` and `recovery_rate=10.0`, how many servers will be infected at the maximum? (1p)

*Your answer here*


### How long does it take until the worm is over? Whiy does it take exactly this time? (2p)

*Your answer here*


### Show the plot `worm_infection_simulation.png` here. (1p)

*Your answer here*


### What happens, if the administrators first patch the susceptible server, then the infected servers? (2p)

You will need to modify the implementation to test this. Describe how the maximum number of infected server changes. Explain why.

### The implementation in the file `models/worm.py` counts for 5 points maximum. (5p)
